Holy moly!
Following along Mr. Tom Chant on this scrimba project and 
completing the strech goals was insightful!
Learned a new skill - data attributes
Realised that on my previous solo project my code was not DRY at all,
could've separated my functions into smaller chunks and have less
event listeners overall!
Learned that you can make a shallow or a deep copy of an object as
each behaves differently!
Added 2 features - beeing able to reply to a specific tweet
                 - beeing able to delete your own tweet
Got to leverage some CDN's for styles and uuid's!
Next one will be another solo project!
